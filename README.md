# Week-4-Challenge

# First import Dependencies and Setup
# Give path for Files to Load 
# Read School and Student Data File and store into Pandas DataFrames
# Lastly, Combine the data into a single dataset


Local Government Area (LGA) Summary:
# First, Calculate school count, student count, and the total budget
# Then Calculate the average maths and reading scores
# After that, Calculate the number of students passing both math and reading (passing grade is above or equal to 50)
# Then Calculate the percentage of studnets passing maths and reading
# Total number of students passing both maths and reading, and find the percentage of that number
# Then Create a "government summary" data frame
# Change the format for the columns for easier reading
# Print the data frame


School Summary:
# First Set index to "school_name"
# Then Find number of studnets per school
# Find the budget for each school
# Find budget per student
# After that, Calculate average scores per school for maths and reading
# Then Calculate number of students passing maths and reading
# Calculate total number of students passing per school 
# Calculate percentage values 
# After that, Calculate total number of students per school who are passing both maths and reading
# Create a new "schools summary" data frame 
# Change the format for the columns for easier reading
# Print the data frame


Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
# Find highest performing schools in "% Overall Passing" by sorting through the data frame in a descending order



Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
# Find highest performing schools in "% Overall Passing" by sorting through the data frame in a ascending order



Maths Scores by Year
# First, Use booleans to create the following grade lists
# Then Find average maths scores for each grade per different schools 
# Create a new "maths scores" data frame 
# Remove the index and print the data frame




Reading Scores by Year
# Find average reading scores for each grade per different schools 
# Then Create a new "reading scores" data frame 
# Remove the index and print the data frame



Scores by School Spending
# Establish the spending bins and group names 
# Then Categorize spending based on the bins
# Find average maths and reading scores by grouping values on "Spending Ranges (Per Student)" for average scores
# After that, Find average maths and reading scores by grouping values on "Spending Ranges (Per Student)" for % passing values
# Find average overall passing scores by grouping values on "Spending Ranges (Per Student)" for % Overall Passing values
# Create a new "school spending" data frame 
# Lastly, Change the format of the following columns and print the data frame



Scores by School Size
# Establish the spending bins and group names 
# Then Categorize spending based on the bins
# Find average maths and reading scores by grouping values on "School Size" for average scores
# After that, Find average maths and reading scores by grouping values on "School Size" for % passing values
# Find average overall passing scores by grouping values on "School Size" for % Overall Passing values
# Create a new "school size" data frame 
# Lastly, print the data frame



Scores by School Type
# Find average maths and reading scores by grouping values on "School Typ" for average scores
# After that, Find average maths and reading scores by grouping values on "School Type" for % passing values
# Find average overall passing scores by grouping values on "School Type" for % Overall Passing values
# Create a new "school type" data frame 
# Lastly, print the data frame
